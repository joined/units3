This project aims to create an API for the University of Trieste ESSE3 system.

ESSE3 is the web application in which the students data, exams & the like are stored.

ESSE3 doesn't offer any sort of API by itself (YOU DON'T SAY?) and this is obviously
restricting if anyone wants to do something with his university career data.

Why would you want to do that? Dunno, let's just say that ESSE3 website doesn't look THAT good, and having the session expire every 15 minutes is ANNOYING. Ok?
